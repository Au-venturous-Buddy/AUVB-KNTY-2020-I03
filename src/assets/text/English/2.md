Located at the very back at the ground floor of the North Towers at SM City North Edsa, elait! is not your ordinary rolled ice cream shop. Yes, we all know that rolled ice cream were a trending item in the 2010s decade, but there's more to this shop than you think! In fact, elait! is staffed by deaf people, and I would like to congratulate them for always doing a job well done! I was even really amazed by how the one whipping up the rolled ice cream mixes up the ingredients together! And if you need to communicate with a staff member at elait!, there are posters which help you learn how to communicate using sign language.
