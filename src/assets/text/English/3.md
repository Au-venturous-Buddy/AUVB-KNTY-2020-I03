Located at the new wing of Robinsons Magnolia, Koomi (which originated from Australia) is a very popular stall that sells very refreshing yoghurt drinks that are bursting with flavorful toppings and mix-ins! Even at first glance, you will feel as if you're in for a relaxing treat, thanks to the purple and pink hues and neon lights that adorn the shop (and most especially the very cute purple cow mascot).
