<h3>Strawberry-Mango Cheesecake</h3>
At elait!, you may opt to either choose from a preset menu or even create your own rolled ice cream flavor. Also, you have a choice of either custard or yoghurt as your ice cream base. I picked this best-selling Strawberry-Mango Cheesecake from their preset menu with yoghurt as my ice cream base. It's bits of strawberries, mango, and cream cheese mixed into the ice cream base, and is generously topped with strawberry preserves, mango preserves, and swirls of condensed milk. It has the perfect balance of sweetness, sourness, and creaminess (but slightly more on the sour side due to the strawberry and mango preserves, plus the cream cheese bits and the yoghurt ice cream base). In all, it tastes very heavenly!
