</h2>Conclusion</h2>
This blog is all about a person (or soon, people) with autism sharing their love for food, but I should definitely leave a lot of room for articles about restaurants that promote inclusion for the disabled people, and elait! is definitely one of those that really impressed me! Their Strawberry-Mango Cheesecake is very creamy and balanced in sweetness, with the sour notes that I like from the mangos, strawberries, cream cheese, and yoghurt. But best of all, I really appreciate the hard work of the deaf staff here at elait!.

So if you want to show support for work inclusion for deaf people, and even learn how to communicate in sign language, elait! should definitely be in your bucket list! ðŸ™‚
