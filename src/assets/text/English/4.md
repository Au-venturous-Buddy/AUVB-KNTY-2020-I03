<h3>Why Not, Coconut?</h3>
First up is Koomi's Why Not, Coconut?, which is a yoghurt drink blended with activated charcoal and desiccated coconut. The coconut actually goes very well with the yoghurt, and both the activated charcoal and the coconut gives this drink a very fine powdery texture as you sip it through a straw (in case you're wondering what activated charcoal tastes like, it actually tastes nothing).

By the way, when you order a drink at Koomi, you can choose between "Aussie Style" or "Pinoy Style" for your yoghurt base (I opted for the "Aussie Style" for this drink and for the other drinks reviewed here, so that I can taste for myself the genuine article).
