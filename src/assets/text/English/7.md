<h3>Stick-On-Me Purple Rice</h3>
Last but not the least is Koomi's Signature drink, the Stick-On-Me Purple Rice! It's just yoghurt with bits of sticky and chewy purple rice, yet when combined together, makes for a very creamy and delightful snack! And the texture is so divine!

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Koomi is indeed a very wonderful yoghurt drink shop! You will feel comfortable with the purple and pink hues that adorn the stall, and their drinks are a perfect balance of sweet and sour, most especially that Stick-On-Me Purple Rice. If you want a healthier alternative to the usual milk tea craze, you may want to check out this awesome store!
